# Graphics Turtle

This was an assessed piece of work during the second semester of my first year at university. While I feel the final product looks and works well, the inernal workings could definitly be improved to make modifiying and extending the project simpler. The program was written while I was still learning a lot about Object Oritented Programming principles and so does follow bad practice in alot of areas. However this is something I want to rectify similar to how football-results-generator received an overhaul. The program is a GUI driven graphics turtle application where the user can draw on a canvas using either commands, on-screen buttons or keyboard keys to contorl the turtle. The user can also import or export their work.

Once the program has been re-written will the rest of the README.md e filled out to help others get the project up and running on their local systems.
